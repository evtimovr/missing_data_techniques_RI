            We introduce a selection model-based multilevel imputation approach to be used within the fully conditional specification framework for multiple imputation. Concretely, we apply a censored bivariate probit model to describe binary variables assumed to be missing not at random. The first equation of the model defines the regression model for the missing data mechanism. The second equation specifies the regression model of the variable to be imputed. The non-random selection of the binary data is mapped by correlations between the error terms of the two regression models. Hierarchical data structures are modelled by random intercepts in both equations. To fit the novel imputation model we use maximum likelihood and adaptive Gauss–Hermite quadrature. A comprehensive simulation study shows the overall performance of the approach. We test its usefulness for empirical research by applying it to a common problem in social scientific research: the emergence of educational aspirations. Our software is designed to be used in the R package mice.},

            Principled methods for analyzing missing values, based chiefly on multiple imputation, have become increasingly popular yet can struggle to handle the kinds of large and complex data that are also becoming common. We propose an accurate, fast, and scalable approach to multiple imputation, which we call MIDAS (Multiple Imputation with Denoising Autoencoders). MIDAS employs a class of unsupervised neural networks known as denoising autoencoders, which are designed to reduce dimensionality by corrupting and attempting to reconstruct a subset of data. We repurpose denoising autoencoders for multiple imputation by treating missing values as an additional portion of corrupted data and drawing imputations from a model trained to minimize the reconstruction error on the originally observed portion. Systematic tests on simulated as well as real social science data, together with an applied example involving a large-scale electoral survey, illustrate MIDAS’s accuracy and efficiency across a range of settings. We provide open-source software for implementing MIDAS.},

Maximum likelihood (ML) methods provide a conceptually straightforward approach to estimation when the outcome is partially missing. Methods of implementing ML methods range from the simple to the complex, depending on the type of data and the missing‐data mechanism. Simple ML methods for ignorable missing‐data mechanisms (when data are missing at random) include complete‐case analysis, complete‐case analysis with covariate adjustment, survival analysis with covariate adjustment, and analysis via propensity‐to‐be‐missing scores. More complex ML methods for ignorable missing‐data mechanisms include the analysis of longitudinal dropouts via a marginal model for continuous data or a conditional model for categorical data. A moderately complex ML method for categorical data with a saturated model and either ignorable or nonignorable missing‐data mechanisms is a perfect fit analysis, an algebraic method involving closed‐form estimates and variances. A complex and flexible ML method with categorical data and either ignorable or nonignorable missing‐data mechanisms is the method of composite linear models, a matrix method requiring specialized software. Except for the method of composite linear models, which can involve challenging matrix specifications, the implementation of these ML methods ranges in difficulty from easy to moderate.},

	abstract = {Data have never been more essential to the success of decision making. However, data are often messy. A perennial data challenge is missing values, which frequently occur in real-world data, such as unreported data items in public firms’ financial statements and skipped product ratings from consumers. What is the influence of missing values and how should they be handled? Although we are in a big data era, missing values are not ignorable if data are missing for nonrandom reasons. In the case of product ratings, if only people who favor the product provide ratings while others put aside the product and do not respond, then even a simple mean estimation of the product rating would be significantly biased. Such bias challenges the validity of data analysis, and it cannot be eliminated simply by increasing the sample size of the data. To correct the bias arising from nonrandom missing values, it is necessary to examine and model what causes the missing values. We propose and demonstrate the superior performance of a Monte Carlo likelihood approach to correct the bias. Overall, we recommend well-designed data collection processes with documentation of the possible reasons for missing values, cautious adoption of missing value handling methods, and structured missing value reporting practices. 
          ,  
            In today’s big data environment, missing values continue to be a problem that harms data quality. The bias caused by missing values raises the highest concern, as it cannot be eliminated simply by increasing the sample size. Although the statistics literature has developed approaches to handling missing values and formulated assumptions regarding when these approaches generate valid statistical inferences, these prescriptions have yet to be broadly accepted by many social science disciplines, including the information systems (IS) discipline. By reviewing recently published empirical research in information systems, we find that missing values are indeed an important and pervasive problem. We believe that a review of missing value theory is necessary and timely for the IS community to understand the nature of missing values and to promote more rigorous research practice when missing values are often unavoidable. In addition, the missing not at random (MNAR) mechanism brings about challenges in parameter estimation. We contribute to research practice by proposing and demonstrating the superior performance of a Monte Carlo likelihood approach in correcting bias in parameter estimation. We conclude by suggesting that research validity can be enhanced through a reasoned adoption of the missing value handling method and structured missing value reporting practices.

	abstract = {The goal of multiple imputation is to provide valid inferences for statistical estimates from incomplete data. To achieve that goal, imputed values should preserve the structure in the data, as well as the uncertainty about this structure, and include any knowledge about the process that generated the missing data. Two approaches for imputing multivariate data exist: joint modeling (JM) and fully conditional specification (FCS). JM is based on parametric statistical theory, and leads to imputation procedures whose statistical properties are known. JM is theoretically sound, but the joint model may lack flexibility needed to represent typical data features, potentially leading to bias. FCS is a semi-parametric and flexible alternative that specifies the multivariate model by a series of conditional models, one for each incomplete variable. FCS provides tremendous flexibility and is easy to apply, but its statistical properties are difficult to establish. Simulation work shows that FCS behaves very well in the cases studied. The present paper reviews and compares the approaches. JM and FCS were applied to pubertal development data of 3801 Dutch girls that had missing data on menarche (two categories), breast development (five categories) and pubic hair development (six stages). Imputations for these data were created under two models: a multivariate normal model with rounding and a conditionally specified discrete model. The JM approach introduced biases in the reference curves, whereas FCS did not. The paper concludes that FCS is a useful and easily applied flexible alternative to JM when no convenient and realistic joint distribution can be specified.},

Existing measures, such as the R-indicator, make the strong assumption that missingness is missing at random, meaning that it depends only on variables that are observed for respondents and nonrespondents. We consider assessment of the impact of nonresponse for a binary survey variable                Y                subject to nonresponse when missingness may be not at random, meaning that missingness may depend on                Y                itself. Our work is motivated by missing categorical income data in the 2015 Ohio Medicaid Assessment Survey (OMAS), where whether or not income is missing may be related to the income value itself, with low-income earners more reluctant to respond. We assume there is a set of covariates observed for nonrespondents and respondents, which for the item nonresponse (as in OMAS) is often a rich set of variables, but which may be potentially limited in cases of unit nonresponse. To reduce dimensionality and for simplicity we reduce these available covariates to a continuous proxy variable                X                , available for both respondents and nonrespondents, that has the highest correlation with                Y                , estimated from a probit regression analysis of respondent data. We extend the previously proposed proxy-pattern mixture (PPM) analysis for continuous outcomes to the binary outcome using a latent variable approach for modeling the joint distribution of                Y                and X. Our method does not assume data are missing at random but includes it as a special case, thus creating a convenient framework for sensitivity analyses. Maximum likelihood, Bayesian, and multiple imputation versions of PPM analysis are described, and robustness of these methods to model assumptions is discussed. Properties are demonstrated through simulation and with the 2015 OMAS data.}, number={3}, journal={Journal of Official Statistics}, author={Andridge, Rebecca R. and Little, Roderick J.A.}, year={2020}, month=sep, pages={703–728}, language={en} }
